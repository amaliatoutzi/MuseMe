# Question

You are a data researcher and formatter. Build a JSON database of museums in New York City.

## Scope

* Geography: New York City (5 boroughs).
* Entities: Museums (art, history, science, children’s, design, photography, etc.). Exclude galleries that are not museums, temporary pop-ups, and venues whose primary business is not a museum.
* Exhibits: Pull from **official museum websites** (preferred) or their official collection/exhibitions portals. Do **not** invent exhibits.

## Data Sources (for ratings and verification)

* Cross-check names and addresses with the museum’s official website or Wikipedia when possible.
* **Exhibits**: Official museum site/collection pages only. If you can’t verify on an official source, **omit the exhibit**.
* Every URL must be http/https and resolvable.

## Fields (per museum)

* id: string  // stable slug, e.g., "the-metropolitan-museum-of-art"
* name: string
* address: string
* zip: string  // 5-digit ZIP
* borough: string  // Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island
* location: { lat: number, lon: number }  // decimal degrees
* website: string  // official site if available
* tags: string\[]  // choose 3–6 from the preset tag vocabulary below
* exhibits: Exhibit\[]       // array; see schema below

## Exhibit object (fields)

* id: string                // lowercase, dashed slug of exhibit name; unique within museum
* name: string
* type: string              // "Permanent" | "Temporary" | "CollectionHighlight"
* gallery?: string          // optional gallery/room label if shown on site
* start\_date?: string       // ISO 8601 (Temporary only, if available)
* end\_date?: string         // ISO 8601 (Temporary only, if available)

## Preset Tag Vocabulary (choose only from this list)

\["Art","Contemporary","Modern","Classical","Sculpture","Photography","Design",
"History","Science","Children","NaturalHistory","Technology","Maritime",
"Immigration","AfricanAmerican","Asian","Hispanic","American",
"Aviation","Transit","PerformingArts","Film","Architecture","Literature"]

## Requirements

* Output a single **JSON array** of objects (no trailing text).
* Include 30–50 museums, prioritizing the most visited/recognized first.
* Deduplicate by normalized name + address (case/whitespace-insensitive).
* Normalize ZIP to 5 digits; normalize borough to the set above.
* Pick 3–6 tags per museum from the vocabulary; do not invent new tags.
* Keep `id` lowercase with dashes: slugify(name).
* Validate all URLs (http/https). No relative links.
* Fill ALL fields; do not use nulls.
* Exhibits:
  * For large museums, include **10–30** notable exhibits: all current **Temporary** exhibitions (if any) + representative **Permanent/CollectionHighlight** entries.
  * If the museum site doesn’t list exhibits clearly, set `exhibits: []`.
* `id` fields (museum/exhibit) are lowercase, dashed slugs; ensure exhibit IDs are unique **per museum**.

## Ordering

* Sort alphabetically by name.

## Quality Checks (perform before you output)

* JSON must be valid and parseable.
* No duplicate ids or names+zip pairs.
* All tags ∈ preset vocabulary.
* zip matches U.S. ZIP regex: ^\d{5}$
* location lat ∈ \[-90,90], lon ∈ \[-180,180].
* For Temporary exhibits, if dates are shown, include ISO `start_date`/`end_date`; otherwise omit those fields.

## Final Output

Return only the JSON array. No commentary.
