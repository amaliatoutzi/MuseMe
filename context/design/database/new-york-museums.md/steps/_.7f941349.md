# Question

You are a data researcher and formatter. Build a JSON database of museums in New York City.

## Scope

* Geography: New York City (5 boroughs).
* Entities: Museums (art, history, science, children’s, design, photography, etc.). Exclude galleries that are not museums, temporary pop-ups, and venues whose primary business is not a museum.

## Data Sources (for ratings and verification)

* Use Google Maps / Google Business Profile as the source of truth for ratings.
* Cross-check names and addresses with the museum’s official website or Wikipedia when possible.
* For each museum, include a direct source URL for the rating (Google Maps place URL). Do not invent ratings.

## Fields (per museum)

* id: string  // stable slug, e.g., "the-metropolitan-museum-of-art"
* name: string
* address: string
* zip: string  // 5-digit ZIP
* borough: string  // Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island
* location: { lat: number, lon: number }  // decimal degrees
* website: string  // official site if available
* google\_rating: number  // 0.0–5.0
* rating\_count: integer  // number of Google reviews
* google\_url: string  // Google Maps place URL used for the rating
* tags: string\[]  // choose 3–6 from the preset tag vocabulary below
* updated\_at: string  // ISO 8601 timestamp (UTC)
* sources: string\[]  // list of source URLs used (must include google\_url)

## Preset Tag Vocabulary (choose only from this list)

\["Art","Contemporary","Modern","Classical","Sculpture","Photography","Design",
"History","Science","Children","NaturalHistory","Technology","Maritime",
"Immigration","Jewish","AfricanAmerican","Asian","Hispanic","American",
"Aviation","Transit","PerformingArts","Film","Architecture","Literature"]

## Requirements

* Output a single **JSON array** of objects (no trailing text).
* Include 30–80 museums, prioritizing the most visited/recognized first.
* Deduplicate by normalized name + address (case/whitespace-insensitive).
* Normalize ZIP to 5 digits; normalize borough to the set above.
* Ratings must come from Google (provide google\_url + rating\_count).
* If a rating cannot be verified, **omit that museum**.
* Pick 3–6 tags per museum from the vocabulary; do not invent new tags.
* Keep `id` lowercase with dashes: slugify(name).
* Validate all URLs (http/https). No relative links.
* Fill ALL fields; do not use nulls.

## Ordering

* Sort descending by google\_rating, then by rating\_count.

## Quality Checks (perform before you output)

* JSON must be valid and parseable.
* No duplicate ids or names+zip pairs.
* All tags ∈ preset vocabulary.
* zip matches U.S. ZIP regex: ^\d{5}$
* google\_rating ∈ \[0,5]; rating\_count ≥ 0; location lat ∈ \[-90,90], lon ∈ \[-180,180].

## Final Output

Return only the JSON array. No commentary.
