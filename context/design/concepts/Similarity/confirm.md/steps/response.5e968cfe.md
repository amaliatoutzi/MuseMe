## Application Pitch - MuseMe Concept Implementation and Testing

This section details the implementation of the `Similarity` concept for MuseMe, followed by a comprehensive test suite.

***

### Concept Implementation

The `Similarity` concept is designed to compute and store item-to-item relatedness within the MuseMe application, facilitating recommendation and discovery. It leverages a content-based similarity approach using tags associated with museums and exhibits.

#### Core Logic:

1. **Catalog Processing:** The concept first processes the `new-york-museums.json` catalog to extract all relevant items (museums and exhibits) and their associated tags. Exhibits are assumed to inherit tags from their parent museum for similarity calculations. Tags are normalized (lowercase, unique) into `Set<string>`.
2. **Cosine Similarity:** The `rebuildSimilarity` action calculates cosine similarity between tag sets of different items.
   * `cosine(i,j) = |tags(i) âˆ© tags(j)| / sqrt(|tags(i)| * |tags(j)|)`
   * Items are only compared if they share at least one tag.
   * Self-links (an item being similar to itself) are explicitly excluded.
3. **Top K Pruning:** For each "from" item, only the top `DEFAULT_TOP_K_NEIGHBORS` (defaulting to 50) most similar "to" items are stored.
4. **Atomic Updates:** When `rebuildSimilarity` is called for a specific scope, all existing similarity links originating from items within that scope are first deleted, and then the newly computed links are inserted. This ensures data consistency.
5. **Neighbor Retrieval:** The `neighbors` action efficiently queries the stored similarity links, returning up to `k` items sorted by score.

1. **Initialize Concept:**
   * A `SimilarityConcept` instance is created, connecting to the test MongoDB database.
   * The `allItemsCatalog` is populated internally from `new-york-museums.json`.

2. **Find Relevant Museums:**
   * The test identifies two museums, `the-metropolitan-museum-of-art` (museumId) and `guggenheim-museum` (highlySimilarMuseumId), which are expected to have a high similarity score due to shared tags (e.g., "Art", "Modern", "European").

3. **Execute `rebuildSimilarity`:**
   * `similarityConcept.rebuildSimilarity({ scope: "museums" })` is called.
   * **Internal Process:**
     * `processMuseumCatalog("museums")` extracts all museum IDs and their tags.
     * The algorithm iterates through all pairs of museums within this scope.
     * For each pair `(m1, m2)`:
       * Self-links (`m1 === m2`) are skipped.
       * Cosine similarity is calculated based on their normalized tag sets.
       * If `m1` and `m2` share at least one tag, a similarity score is computed.
       * The calculated `SimilarityLink` objects (containing `from`, `to`, `score`, `updatedAt`) are stored temporarily.
     * After all pairs are processed, for each `from` museum, only the top 50 (default `DEFAULT_TOP_K_NEIGHBORS`) links by score are retained.
     * All existing `SimilarityLinks` where `from` is a museum ID in the current scope are deleted from the `Similarity.Links` MongoDB collection.
     * The newly computed and pruned links are inserted into `Similarity.Links`.
   * **Expected Output:** An empty `{}` object, indicating successful completion.

4. **Execute `neighbors`:**
   * `similarityConcept.neighbors({ item: "the-metropolitan-museum-of-art" as ItemId, k: 5 })` is called.
   * **Internal Process:**
     * The method first validates `k` (ensures `k >= 1`) and the `item` ID (ensures it exists in `allItemsCatalog`).
     * It then queries the `Similarity.Links` MongoDB collection for documents where `from` matches `the-metropolitan-museum-of-art`.
     * The results are sorted by `score` in descending order.
     * The query is limited to `k=5` results.
     * Only the `to` (neighbor ID) field is projected from the matching documents.
   * **Expected Output:** An object `{ neighbors: ItemId[] }`, containing a list of up to 5 `ItemId`s representing the most similar museums to `the-metropolitan-museum-of-art`, ordered by their similarity score. The `guggenheim-museum` is expected to be present in this list (potentially requiring a check beyond just the top 5 if its rank is lower, but confirming its presence in the top 50).

5. **Assertions:**
   * The test asserts that `rebuildSimilarity` returns successfully.
   * It asserts that `neighbors` returns a non-empty array of `ItemId`s.
   * It specifically checks if `guggenheim-museum` (our `highlySimilarMuseumId`) is present in the returned list of neighbors for `the-metropolitan-museum-of-art`.

This trace demonstrates that similarity links are correctly computed, stored, and then retrieved, fulfilling the purpose of storing item-to-item relatedness for ranking flows.
