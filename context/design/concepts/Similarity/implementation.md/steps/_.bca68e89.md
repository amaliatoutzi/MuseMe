# Notes

* Check that the ID of museum or exhibit are valid by ensuring they are in the file `new-york-museums.json` which is a database of all museums. You can import a local JSON catalog: import museumsRaw from "@utils/new-york-museums.json" with { type: "json" };
* Keep this concept generic for items (museums or exhibits).
