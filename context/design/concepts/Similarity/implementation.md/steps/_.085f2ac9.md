# CONCEPT TO IMPLEMENT (authoritative spec; treat “principle” as operational behavior)

## concept **Similarity** \[Item]

**purpose**
store item-to-item relatedness usable by ranking flows

**principle**
if **SimilarityLinks(from, to)** with **score** exists, then neighbor queries for **from** may surface **to** ranked by **score**; rebuilding recomputes these scores atomically for the chosen scope.

**state**
a set of **SimilarityLinks** with

* a from **ItemId**
* a to **ItemId**
* a score **Number** *(higher means more similar)*
* an updatedAt **DateTime**

**actions**
**rebuildSimilarity**(scope?: Scope) : Empty | { error: String }

* effects (re)compute **SimilarityLinks** for the specified scope *(e.g., all museums or exhibits)*; set `updatedAt := now`

**neighbors**(item: ItemId, k: Number) : { neighbors: ItemId\[] } | { error: String }

* requires `k ≥ 1`
* effects return up to `k` items with highest score where `from = item`
