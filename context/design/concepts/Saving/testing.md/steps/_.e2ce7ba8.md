# CONCEPT TO IMPLEMENT (authoritative spec; treat “principle” as operational behavior)

## concept **Saving** \[User, Item]

**purpose**
let a user mark/unmark any item to revisit later (“save” a museum)

**principle**
if **Saved(user,item)** exists, then that item should appear in the user’s saved list; removing it deletes the single source of truth for that saved state.

**state**
a set of **Saved** with

* a user **User**
* an item **ItemId**
* a createdAt **DateTime**

**actions**
**saveItem**(user: User, item: ItemId)

* requires user exists and Saved(user, item) not present
* effects create Saved(user, item, createdAt := now)

**unsaveItem**(user: User, item: ItemId)

* requires Saved(user, item) exists
* effects delete that Saved

**listSaved**(user: User) : List<ItemId>

* requires user exists
* effects return up to `limit` items saved by user
