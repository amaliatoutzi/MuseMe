# Prompt : I updated the concept spec as such:

concept **UserPreferences** \[User, Tag]

**purpose**
store durable taste tags for ranking and cold-start for individual users.

**principle**
if a **Preference(user, tag)** exists, then ranking functions may treat that tag as an enduring positive signal for **user** until removed.
The validity of the `tag` ID itself is guaranteed by the calling context (e.g., a TagCatalog concept or application-level validation).

**state**

a set of **Preferences** with

* a user **User**
* a tag **Tag**
* a createdAt **DateTime**

**actions**
**addPreference**(user: User, tag: Tag)

* requires user exists, tag is a valid and existing tag ID (externally verified), and Preferences(user, tag) not present
* effects create Preferences(user, tag, createdAt := now)

**removePreference**(user: User, tag: Tag)

* requires Preferences(user, tag) exists
* effects delete that Preferences

Now what changes should I make to my implementation and testing?
