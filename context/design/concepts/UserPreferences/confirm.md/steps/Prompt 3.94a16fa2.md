# Prompt 3: I want preset tags to be universal. so like I can remove them from the state but then I need the tags from user preferences to be from within a set that contains the preset tags (perhaps they could be defined inside utils and I could just import them). Could they be a generic type or a set in the concept spec? The preset tags are hardcoded and they are always the same set.
