# response:

To implement the `Reviewing` concept for MuseMe, we'll create a TypeScript class `ReviewingConcept` that manages user reviews for items (museums or exhibits) using MongoDB. This concept will ensure a single source of truth for each user's rating of a specific item, handling creation, updates, and deletion of reviews.
