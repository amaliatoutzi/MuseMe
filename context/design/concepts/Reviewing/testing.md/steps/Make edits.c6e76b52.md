# Make edits:

The ID of museum or exhibit that you use must be in the file `new-york-museums.json`  for them to be valid. Add a testcase to check that invalid names give errors.

Each test should be a new Dyno.test so Deno.test("", async (t) => { ... } ) for eaach testcase. Mark clearly which is the test for the operational principle.
