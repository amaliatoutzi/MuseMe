# response:

To implement the `Reviewing` concept, we'll create a TypeScript class `ReviewingConcept` that interacts with a MongoDB collection. We'll define the `STARS` type, the `Review` interface, and implement the `upsertReview` and `clearReview` actions as specified.

We'll assume the existence of utility types `ID` and `Empty`, and a `freshID()` function from `@utils/types.ts` and `@utils/database.ts` respectively, as described in the prompt.
