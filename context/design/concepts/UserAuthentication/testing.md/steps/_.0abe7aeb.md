# CONCEPT TO IMPLEMENT (authoritative spec; treat “principle” as operational behavior)

## concept **UserAuthentication** \[User]

**purpose**
limit access to known users

**principle**
after a user registers with a username and a password, they can authenticate with the same username+password and be treated as the same user.

**state**
a set of **Credentials** with

* an owner **User**
* a username **String** (unique)
* a passwordHash **Hash**
* a createdAt **DateTime**
* an updatedAt **DateTime**

**actions**
**register**(username: String, password: String) : User

* requires no existing Credentials with this username
* effects create Credentials(owner := new User, username, passwordHash := hash(password), createdAt := now, updatedAt := now); return owner

**authenticate**(username: String, password: String): User

* requires Credentials(username) exists and verifyHash(password, passwordHash)
* effects none
