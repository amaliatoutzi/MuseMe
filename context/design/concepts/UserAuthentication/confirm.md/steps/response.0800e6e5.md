# response:

The provided `UserAuthenticationConcept.test.ts` has been refactored to place each test scenario into its own top-level `Deno.test` block. The error message assertions for empty/whitespace credentials have been updated to match the specific error messages returned by the `UserAuthenticationConcept` implementation (`"Username cannot be empty."` and `"Password cannot be empty."`). Crucially, the case-sensitivity test has been corrected to properly demonstrate that usernames are treated as case-sensitive by attempting to authenticate with a different casing of a *registered* username, expecting a generic authentication failure.
