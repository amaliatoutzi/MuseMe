# Application pitch

## Product Summary

* **Name:** MuseMe
* **Core idea:** A friends-only diary and discovery app for museum lovers.
* **Visits:** Users create visit entries (pick museum → add exhibits → notes → photos).
* **Ratings:** Unified **1–5 stars** for both museums and exhibits; ratings shape recommendations.
* **Friends-Only Social:** Only **mutual follows** can view each other’s visits/ratings.
* **Save for Later:** Users can **save/unsave** museums to a personal shortlist.
* **Taste Tags:** Optional user preference tags help personalize discovery.
* **Recommendations:** Powered by existing data: similarity over items + user ratings + preference tags.
* **Catalog assumption:** Museums & exhibits already exist in the database.
* **Privacy model:** Friends-only; no public browsing of user content.

## Conceptual Constraints (operational principles)

* **Following:** Friendship = mutual follows; access checks happen at the application boundary.
* **Reviewing \[User, Item]:** A single source of truth for 1–5 star ratings (optional note).
* **Visit \[User, Museum]:** Diary for notes/photos per exhibit; do **not** store ratings here.
* **Similarity \[Item]:** Item-to-item relatedness for ranking; rebuilt offline or on demand.
* **Saving \[User, Item]:** Users can save/unsave items (museums now; extensible to exhibits).
* **UserPreferences \[User, Tag]:** Durable taste tags from a preset list.
* **UserAuthentication:** Username identifies user .

## Audience & Tone

* Audience: museum-goers (teens to adults), privacy-conscious, social with close friends.
* Tone: warm, concise, modern, energetic but not hypey. Avoid jargon.
