# Changes - Following

## Changes

- While initially I had replaced Profile concept with some smaller concepts like Following, Saving, and UserAuthentication, while developing my app I realised I want to hold a profile picture and a first and last name
- I decided to add the profile concept back but only keep it to store the essential profile details (while still keeeping the rest modular).

## Issues encountered

- I developed this with an agent instead of context and it worked way better.
- I did not encounter any issues (it was easy since I gave the example of other fully implemented concepts)
